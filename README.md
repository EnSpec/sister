# SISTER
## Space-based Imaging Spectroscopy and Thermal pathfindER

This repository contains code for implementing prototype algorithm workflows
for the Space-based Imaging Spectroscopy and Thermal pathfindER (SISTER).

This repository is under active development and currently contains
code for preprocessing imaging spectroscopy data from airborne and spaceborne
sensors for input into higher level algorithms including atmospheric, topographic
and BRDF correction algorithms.
